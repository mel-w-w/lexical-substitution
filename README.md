# lexical-substitution

This project was completed for the course Natural Language Processing in Columbia University.

Project goal:
- Work on a lexical substitution task using, WordNet, pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings, and BERT. The task is to find lexical substitutes for individual target words in context.

My code can primarily be found in the file `lexsub_main.py`.
